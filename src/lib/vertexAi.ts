1. ZOOM LEVEL: This image was taken with a zoom level of ${zoom}x
   - If zoom > 1: The image shows a closer, more detailed view - objects appear larger
   - If zoom < 1: The image shows a wider, more distant view - objects appear smaller
   - If zoom = 1: Standard view with normal perspective

2. SCANNING AND DISTANCE ANALYSIS:
   - Examine the image to determine how far the camera was from the wall
   - Look for visual cues like shadows, perspective, and object relationships
   - Consider the apparent size of objects in the image relative to the zoom level
   - Analyze the depth and distance perception in the scene

3. ACCURATE DIMENSION ESTIMATION:
   - Use the zoom level to adjust your size estimates appropriately
   - Account for the camera distance and perspective distortion
   - Provide dimensions that reflect the actual wall size, not the apparent size in the image

Estimate the width and height of the wall in feet, considering the zoom level and scanning distance. Respond ONLY as JSON: {"width": <number>, "height": <number>}`,
